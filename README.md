# Pokemon Battler 

The Pokemon Battler was my first Project with a team. It was very ambisous and we were way in over our heads. On that note, I am still very proud at what we made in such a limited amount of time and knowledge.

# Pokemon Fight Revamped

This is Pokemon Fight Revamped, this is a solo project after coming back to python while still learning other languages and frameworks. I figured I'd learn pygame eventually since it allowed me to have a GUI

After 3 days of research and coding, I managed to make something I felt was worth showing. It's not over, I will come back and debug it, but for now, I have a framework to learn.
